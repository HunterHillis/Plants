# Plants
Python project that involves scrapping, cleaning, and loading data  

This project is broken into key 5 elements:
1) Scraping a website
2) Cleaning the data to a database friendly format
3) Creating a database and loading the data
4) Creating a clustering ML model for identifying plants with similar characteristics not in the original dataset
5) Creating a visualization of results in Tableau/PowerBI

*Each of these elements is broken out into a seperate .py notebook for modularization and organization
